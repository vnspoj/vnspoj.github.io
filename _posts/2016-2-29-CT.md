Consider a 2D integer grid with lower left corner at (0, 0) and upper right corner at (X, Y). We are interested in isosceles right triangles which all the 3 corners at the grid node (integer coordinates). Your task is to count the number of those triangles.

#### Input

The input begins with C – number of test cases.  
Each test case consists of X, Y.

#### Output

For each test case, output the result in a line.

#### Limits

C <= 20  
0 <= X, Y <= 1000

  
```
Sample input  
2  
0 3  
1 1
  
Sample output  
0  
4
```
